\section*{Abstract}
Discuss the concpet of coexistence and how plants have this in order for them to thrive as a species. Also, I will mention that certain planst do not have positive interactions with other and actaully release toxic chemicals, which decrease the likelyhood of two species to be able to coexist with one another.

\section{Introduction}
The purpose of the study and the data that I decided to manipulate was to see how different species of plant-plant interactions play a role in different levels of arid environments. There is a two-phase mosaic structure of how covered the vegetation patches are (banded and spotted.) However, recent studies indicate striking similarities in patch dynamics and in mechanisms explaining their origin and maintenance. The banded and spotted vegetation, which are characterized by patch shape, both originate from common mechanisms, although each is dominated by a different driver. Banded vegetation is predominantly seen where water is the dominant driver of redistribution of materials, and spotted vegetation occurs when wind is the major factor.

From the past, the ubiquitous technique that was utilized for plant interactions was one that was directed towards reducing competition (increase facilitation) amongst the pre-existing vegetation. With increasing usage of facilitation as a main process of regulating the makeup of communities; a change in the usage of restoration for better awareness of the benefits of plant communities has led to conserving vegetation. Its important to note that semiarid and tropical systems, on average had a positive association with neighborhood effects than the wetlands, where negative interactions were prevalent. It will be intriguing to see, as we further delve into this plant-plant interactions on how different levels of aridity, with different types of plant species (nurse shrubs, allelopathy shrubs, and perennial grass) lead to different levels of coexistence.

\section{Results}
I plan to state the results for the coexistence variance amongst the three different species (the perennial grass, Lygeum
spartum, the allelopathic dwarf shrub, Artemisia herba-alba, and the nurse shrub, Salsola vermiculata) and how the aridity (low aridness and high aridity)  of the environment played a role in the coexistence variance.

\section{Discussion}
I plan to come up with a plausible expalnation form the data that I have manupulated to see if there was another cause and effect relationship that was not stated in the original article, such as comparing the expected and real coexistence amongst two different species in different aridity environments as well.
